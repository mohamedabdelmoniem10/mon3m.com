            My name is Mohamed Abdelmoniem. one of my hobbies is learning new
            stuff. In 2016, a friend told me that you have to learn HTML, CSS,
            and Javascript to make a website, and without any doubt, I started a
            learning journey with some upset times and other hopeful times.
            Eventually, in 2019, I had started work as a mean stack developer,
            then frontend developer til now.
